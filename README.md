# 📊 Smart Score Classifier (SSC)

A simple and beginner-friendly Machine Learning project that predicts whether a student will **Pass or Fail** based on academic performance indicators using **Logistic Regression**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Smart Score Classifier** is designed to demonstrate the complete Machine Learning workflow in a clear and understandable way.  
It uses a small custom dataset and focuses on **training accuracy** and **testing accuracy**, making it ideal for learning and academic use.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Predict student results (**Pass / Fail**) using:
- Study Hours  
- Attendance Percentage  
- Previous Academic Score  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset Description

| Feature        | Description                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| study_hours    | Number of hours studied             |
| attendance     | Attendance percentage               |
| prev_score     | Previous exam score                 |
| result         | Target variable (0 = Fail, 1 = Pass)|

## 🔄 Machine Learning Workflow

1. Data Creation  
2. Feature Selection  
3. Train-Test Split  
4. Model Training (Logistic Regression)  
5. Training Accuracy Evaluation  
6. Testing Accuracy Evaluation  

---

## 📈 Model Performance

- **Training Accuracy:** High (model learns patterns well)  
- **Testing Accuracy:** Moderate (demonstrates generalization)  

This balance helps explain **overfitting vs underfitting** concepts clearly.
